Minimal habitat area prediction for detecting new rare species



This is an R script,developed by Youhua Chen and Tsung-Jen Shen, for estimating the minimal habitat area required to detect some individuals of a single or a few rare species that have not been previously detected.
Our method is community-based as it heavily relies on original sample area size and the abundance frequency of species observed in the original sample area. 
Based on the Poisson-based sampling theory that can connect the size of original sample area and abundance frequency, it then estimate the minimal habitat area size required to detect
new rare species. 

Details on the estimation methods have been described in the following paper:

Chen YH, Shen TJ (2023) Minimum habitat size required to detect new rare species. Under Review.
