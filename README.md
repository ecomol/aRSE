Minimal habitat area prediction for detecting new rare species



This is the script for estimating the minimal habitat area required to detect some individuals of a single or a few rare species that have not been previously detected.
Our method is community-based as it heavily relies on original sample area size and the abundance frequency of species observed in the original sample area. 
Based on the Poisson-based sampling theory that can connect the size of original sample area and abundance frequency, it then estimate the minimal habitat area size required to detect
new rare species.
